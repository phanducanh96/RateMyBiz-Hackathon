 There are 2 Templates: React and HTML5. We can use either of them.
 
 I'd prefer using React and have HTML5 as a rollback if we needed to, or time is limited. Though I'm not fully experienced with it, we can learn while doing lol
 
 **Testing React**: You will need to install Node JS on your machine. Open a terminal, cd to the Template folder and enter **npm install**. You might have to do **npm audit fix**. After all of that, execute **npm start**
 
 **Testing HTML5**: Just simply open the html pages
