 There are 3 Templates: React and HTML5. We can use either of them.
 
 I'd prefer using React and have HTML5 as a rollback if we needed to, or time is limited. Though I'm not fully experienced with it, we can learn while doing lol
 
 **Testing React**: You will need to install Node JS on your machine. Open a terminal, cd to the Template folder and enter **npm install**. You might have to do **npm audit fix**. After all of that, execute **npm start**
 
For the new DashBoard Template I uploaded, **npm install** did not work well installing all the dependencies. Hence, I switched to **yarn**. You can install **yarn** by executing **npm install --global yarn**. Use terminal to cd to the Star-Admin-DashBoard folder, then **yarn install**, **yarn start**

You will also need to create a **.env.local** file in the Star-Admin-DashBoard folder as well; so that the project can have all the Firebase info. The content of the file is in **#env** channel in the discord server
 
 **Testing HTML5**: Just simply open the html pages
